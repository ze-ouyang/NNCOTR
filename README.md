**NNCOTR: Neural-Network-based reconstruction of the 3D structure of relativistic electron bunches by Coherent Optical Transition Radiation**

---
# Introduction
Transition Radiation (TR) is emitted when a charged particle crosses from one medium into another with different index of refractive. For electron bunches accelerated from Laser-Wakefield-Accelerator (LWFA), they can drive TR into Optical range, i.e. Coherent Optical Transition Radiation (COTR).
