**NNCOTR: Neural-Network-based reconstruction of the 3D structure of relativistic electron bunches by Coherent Optical Transition Radiation**

---
# Introduction
Transition Radiation (TR) is emitted when a charged particle crosses from one medium into another with different index of refractive. For electron bunches accelerated from Laser-Wakefield-Accelerator (LWFA), TR can be coherently emitted even down to optical range, i.e. Coherent Optical Transition Radiation (COTR). Different 3D structure of the electron bunch lead to different COTR patterns at different wavelengths, whose physical model is well understood. And we refer this as the forward process, from $\rho(x_s,y_s,z_s)$ to $S(x_d,y_d,\lambda)$, where "s" stands for source, and "d" stands for detector recording COTR signal.

Therefore, COTR contains the 3D structure information of the electron bunches. However, obtaining such info from COTR is not as straight forward as the aforementioned physical model, because of the complicated mathematical f
